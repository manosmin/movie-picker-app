# Movie Picker App

A web app that utilizes [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to provide a search engine for movies, series, episodes, games and more using React.js 🎬.

You can search movies by typing your queries in the appropriate boxes and then pressing the glass 🔎 button. Pressing on a card image will redirect you to the corresponding IMDb page.

You can see more details about a movie, by typing the ID in the appropriate box (e.g. tt0147612).

If you are indecisive 😋 the app can suggest a random movie, by pressing the die button 🎲.

It also supports pagination, by clicking on the arrow at the top right of the screen ➡️.

The app has a fully responsive design implemented with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/), so you can use it from mobile 📱.
